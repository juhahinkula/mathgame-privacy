# MathGame – Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 22, 2025

## 1. General information

This Privacy Policy explains how the MathGame app handles user information.  
MathGame is a free educational game for iOS and Android that helps children practice basic math. The app contains no ads and does not collect personal information.

## 2. Information we collect

MathGame does not collect, transmit, or share personal data about users. The app stores only non‑personal game progress locally on the device (for example: completed levels, settings, selected avatar). No player-identifying data is sent to external servers.

## 3. Third‑party services

MathGame does not use analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app does not use Apple Game Center, Google Play Games, or similar online game services.

## 4. Data storage and security

All game progress and settings are saved locally on the user's device using the app's private storage. No data is uploaded to the developer's servers. Users are responsible for device backups if they wish to preserve progress across devices.

## 5. User rights

Because MathGame does not collect personal data, there is no personal information to access, correct, or delete. To remove local progress, uninstall the app or clear the app data via the device settings.

## 6. Children’s privacy

MathGame is suitable for children. The app collects no personal data, contains no ads, and does not use external tracking or analytics.
